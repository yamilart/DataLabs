# GNOD Project

As the final project before the final project we had to create a song recommender based on some features and playlists.  
The full information about the project can be found [here](https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-web-scraping-single-page/blob/master/case-study-gnod.md)

## Song Suggester

**MVP**: Creating a recomendation engine that can check if the song you submit is in the Billboard Hop 100 songs and, if it is, return another song from the same list.

**The extra mile**: Adding to that engine the possibility to search for the entered son on Spotify and, if found, recommend another song from a previously created cluster of songs.
