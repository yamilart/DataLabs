## WEEK 1

Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit, Scipy, Data Cleaning, EDA, Machine Learning: Linear Regression

### Day 1

**Getting started with Jupyter Notebook and Python**

As a first project we had to create a jupiter nootebook using extensions, text editting and some python coding.

 ### Days 2 - 3 - 4 - 5
 
**Understanding customer demographics and buying behavior**

During the rest of the first week we worked on the same database by joining together 3 csv files.
The data belongs to a made up car insurance company and contains information about their customers and the type of insurance and car they have.
To execute the labs we followed the data analysis proccess:
- Case Study
- Get data
- Cleaning/Wrangling/EDA
- Processing Data
- Modeling
- Validation
- Reporting

The objective was to end up using predictive analytics to analyze the most profitable customers and how they interact and take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

The project was developed during several rounds, in the first week we worked on the first three, consisting in:

- [**Round 1:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound1.ipynb)
  - Gathering the data and turning it into a dataframe to work with.
  - Data cleaning : standardizing header names, rearranging columns as needed, concatenanting the data and separating it into categorical and numerical.

- [**Round 2:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound2.ipynb)
  - Dealing with the datetime format.

- [**Round 3:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound3.ipynb)
  - Plotting the information using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we used different plots to visualize and analize the data:
