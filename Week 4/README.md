## WEEK 4

Combining SQL and Python to work with Machine Learning Models

### Day 1
 
***Working with subqueries in SQL using the Sakila database***

Last lab using only SQL, we had to apply subqueries to filter and organize the data.

- You can find it [here](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%204/Lab-SQL-Subqueries.sql)
 
 ### Day 2
 
***Combined SQL and Python to make predictions with logistic regression, using the Sakila database***

*In progress*

### Day 3

***Bonus Lab: Iris class prediction***

A Lab made with the TA mixing machine learning and the developing of a nice readme to explain the proccess
