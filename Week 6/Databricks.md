# Lab | DataBricks  

After a general tutorial in class we had to do 3 self guided Databricks notebooks
It kind of looks and works like a Jupyter Notebook so the learning curve for the platform itself it's not really hard

## 1.- PandastoKoalas tutorial 🐼 → 🐨

It was really interesting to see that Pandas is not really practical when handling huge databases but Koalas does. Also, they won me over with the cute animal names

Since it was a tutorial it was easier to do than a normal lab but it was interesting to know the similarities between creating dataframes on each package
