# Lab | DataBricks  

After a general tutorial in class we had to do 3 self guided Databricks notebooks and submit a readme explaining the process followed and learnings
It kind of looks and works like a Jupyter Notebook so the learning curve for the platform itself it's not really hard

## 1.- PandastoKoalas tutorial 🐼 → 🐨

It was really interesting to see that Pandas is not really practical when handling huge databases but Koalas does. Also, they won me over with the cute animal names

Since it was a tutorial it was easier to do than a normal lab but it was interesting to know the similarities between creating dataframes on each package

Also creating plots it's as easy as using pandas since malplotlib can handle both cute animals

## 2.- Spark SQL and DataFrames 🗒️

Spark SQL is quite similar to the MySQL language, and it was nice learning about how it's possible to run queries easily and also export databases to work with.

## 3.- Optional: MarketBasket 🛒

A Machine Learning project using Frequent Pattern

The perk of using Databricks with such a big dataset is that it took a super short amount of time compared with running the model on python using jupyter notebook

I've anyway decided to grab a random piece of the data to run the model also on jupyter notebook to have a go with Frequent Pattern
