## Who let the dogs out? üêæ

Final Project: A dog Breed Recognition Project

### A Data Analysis Project...

**With images!**

As my final project I decided to dig into Computer Vision and create a Dog Breed Recognition program because... why not?
 
 ### About
 
**The data**

I decided to work with a dataset from Kaggle that I customize to my needs because it didn't have any Dachshunds.  

- [The data]
- Get data
- Cleaning/Wrangling/EDA
- Processing Data
- Modeling
- Validation
- Reporting

The objective was to end up using predictive analytics to analyze the most profitable customers and how they interact and take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

The project was developed during several rounds, in the first week we worked on the first three, consisting in:

- [**Round 1:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound1.ipynb)
  - Gathering the data and turning it into a dataframe to work with.
  - Data cleaning : standardizing header names, rearranging columns as needed, concatenanting the data and separating it into categorical and numerical.

- [**Round 2:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound2.ipynb)
  - Dealing with the datetime format.

- [**Round 3:**](https://github.com/yamilart/DataLabs/blob/main/Week%201/Lab-CustomerAnalysisRound3.ipynb)
  - Plotting the information using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we used different plots to visualize and analize the data:
