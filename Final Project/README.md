Final Project: A dog Breed Recognition Project

### A Data Analysis Project...

**With images!**

As my final project I decided to dig into Computer Vision and create a Dog Breed Recognition program because... why not?


## About
 
**The basics**

I decided to work with a dataset from Kaggle that I customize to my needs because it didn't have any Dachshunds...

## The process

My data consisted in over 10000 dog pictures classified in 120 breeds.  
Since that was going to take a lot of time and computer power to build i decided to use only 20 breeds, wich resulted in around 1600 pictures.    
The selected breeds were:

After the seleccion and several failed attempts I decided to build a sequential model using a pre-trained ResNet50 layer.   
Basically: a layer that already recognizes images, so it would be easier for it to learn and it could give a good accuracy.  
The said results were:

## The App!

*Hey mom! I created an app!*.   
After some struggle and few hours of sleep I managed to deploy my model and to use it with any updated picture.   
[**Try it out!**](https://share.streamlit.io/yamilart/streamlit-dogbreed/breed_app.py) (remember it only works on the 20 breeds mentioned before)   
In case it's not working, here are some screenshots of the outcomes:
